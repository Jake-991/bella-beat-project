Bellabeat Data Analysis Case Study
## Ask: Define the Business Problem and Objectives
### Project Overview
This case study is part of the Google Data Analysis Certification program, designed to provide actionable insights to Bellabeat, a wellness technology company focused on empowering women. The aim of this analysis is to help Bellabeat enhance their product offerings and refine their marketing strategies based on users’ engagement data and health patterns.

### Business Context
Bellabeat is a company that develops wearable health products for women, including fitness trackers that provide users with insights into their daily activity levels, sleep patterns, and overall wellness. With the increasing competition in the smart wellness market, Bellabeat seeks to strengthen its position by leveraging data to understand user behavior and preferences. By identifying key trends and correlations within user data, Bellabeat can develop targeted product features and marketing campaigns to increase user engagement and satisfaction.

### Problem Statement
Bellabeat needs to understand how users interact with their wellness devices and the impact of these devices on users' activity levels and lifestyle habits. Specifically, the company wants to explore patterns and trends related to physical activity, sleep duration, calorie consumption, and heart rate data to optimize product features and marketing efforts. The ultimate goal is to increase user retention and engagement while enhancing the overall user experience.

### Key Questions to Address
To provide meaningful insights and recommendations, the following questions will guide the analysis:

### Activity Patterns:

What are the most popular types of physical activities users engage in (e.g., steps, active minutes)?
How do activity levels vary throughout the day, and are there peak times when users are most active?
### User Behavior Analysis:

How does user behavior differ between weekdays and weekends in terms of activity levels, calorie burn, and sleep duration?
What factors correlate with higher levels of physical activity (e.g., heart rate, sleep quality)?
### Calorie and Sleep Monitoring:

How do users’ calorie consumption and burn patterns align with their activity levels?
Are there specific sleep patterns or habits that correlate with increased activity levels or higher overall wellness scores?
### Demographic and Behavioral Segmentation:

Are there specific user segments (e.g., age groups, activity levels) that demonstrate higher engagement rates or consistent product usage?
How can Bellabeat better personalize recommendations and marketing campaigns to target these segments effectively?
### Project Objective
The objective of this case study is to provide Bellabeat with actionable insights that will:

Optimize Product Features: Identify areas for improvement in Bellabeat’s devices and app based on user activity and engagement patterns, including the introduction of new features or updates that align with user behavior.
Enhance Marketing Strategies: Develop data-driven marketing strategies aimed at increasing user engagement by targeting peak activity periods, promoting consistent usage, and emphasizing health benefits based on actual user outcomes.
Increase User Retention: Leverage findings to create tailored recommendations that enhance the overall user experience, leading to increased user satisfaction and retention.
Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders for this project include:

Bellabeat Management Team: Responsible for strategic decisions related to product development and marketing initiatives.
Product Development Team: Focused on incorporating user feedback and data insights into future updates and new product features.
Marketing and Sales Team: Tasked with designing and executing targeted campaigns to increase product adoption and user retention.
Deliverables
At the conclusion of this project, the following deliverables will be provided:

### Comprehensive Report: A detailed report summarizing findings, insights, and actionable recommendations.
### Interactive Dashboard: An interactive visualization tool displaying key insights on user behavior and engagement patterns.
### Presentation: A professional presentation for Bellabeat stakeholders, outlining strategic recommendations for product and marketing optimization.
By addressing these questions and delivering actionable insights, this case study aims to empower Bellabeat to make data-driven decisions that enhance their product offerings and marketing strategies, ultimately contributing to their growth and success in the wellness technology market.

## Prepare: Data Collection and Preparation
### Overview
The Prepare phase involves collecting, understanding, and preparing the dataset for analysis. In this case study, we use data from Bellabeat’s wellness devices, which track various health metrics such as daily activity, sleep patterns, heart rate, and calorie consumption. The purpose of this step is to ensure that the data is well-structured, accurate, and ready for the subsequent cleaning and analysis stages.

### Data Sources
The dataset consists of multiple CSV and Excel files that cover a wide range of wellness and activity metrics collected from Bellabeat users. Below is a summary of each data source:

Daily Activity Data: Contains information on daily steps, active minutes, and total distance traveled.
Sleep Data: Tracks users’ sleep duration and sleep quality metrics.
Heart Rate Data: Records heart rate readings at different intervals.
Calorie Data: Captures calorie burn details across various activities and time intervals.
Weight and BMI Logs: Provides details on users’ weight, body mass index (BMI), and related metrics over time.
### Data Understanding
Each dataset includes different variables that provide insights into user behavior and wellness. Below is a summary of the key variables:

Time-Based Variables:
Date: The date on which the data was recorded.
Time: The time interval for minute/hourly data (e.g., heart rate, calories, steps).
Activity Variables:
Steps: The number of steps taken in a day or minute/hour interval.
Active Minutes: Time spent in various activity intensities (e.g., lightly active, fairly active, and very active).
Calories Burned: Total calories burned per day or interval.
Sleep Variables:
Sleep Duration: Total time spent sleeping per day.
Sleep Quality: Indicators such as REM sleep, deep sleep, and wake times.
Health Metrics:
Heart Rate: The user’s heart rate recorded at different time intervals.
Weight and BMI: Users’ weight and body mass index over time.
### Data Preparation Steps
To ensure the data is ready for analysis, the following preparation steps were taken:

Data Importation:

All datasets were imported into the analysis environment (Excel, BigQuery Power BI).
Initial exploratory analysis was performed to understand the structure and content of each dataset.
Data Validation:

Checked for missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies across datasets.
Verified the date and time formats for consistency, ensuring that all time-based variables were standardized.
Data Integration:

Merged datasets where necessary (e.g., merging daily activity data with sleep data) to create a comprehensive view of user behavior.
Ensured proper alignment of time intervals when combining minute-level data with daily summaries.
Data Documentation:

Each dataset was documented to capture variable descriptions, units of measurement, and data types.
Developed a data dictionary to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the analysis process.
Data Limitations
It is important to note the following limitations and considerations related to the dataset:

Sample Size: The data represents only a subset of Bellabeat users, which may not be fully representative of the overall user base.
Time Frame: The data covers a specific period; trends observed may be influenced by seasonality or other time-based factors.
Data Integrity: Some missing values and inconsistencies were observed, particularly in the sleep and heart rate datasets. Strategies such as imputation or filtering may be required during the cleaning process.
